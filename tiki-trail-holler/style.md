# Dawn Dog & Dusk Drift - Style.md

## Overall Vibe
Upbeat tropical country holler with yacht-rock polish—smooth coastal sway meets Appalachian grit. 70% sunshine fist-pumps, 30% rootsy ache. Key: G Lydian—raised fourth (C#) lifts airy like gull thermals. Tempo: 85 BPM intro, swellin' to 110 BPM verses/chorus. Structure: Intro → V1 → Chorus → V2 → Electric Solo → Chorus → Bridge → Final Chorus → Outro (~3:45). Themes: Beach escape, the dog's loyalty, grind-chasin' grace.

## Instrumentation
- **Core:** Acoustic guitar (fingerpick open D tuning, raw wood warmth drivin' the lore, easy Em-D-C#m shapes) + steel string guitar (weeping modal bends, yacht-smooth twang)—standup bass (lazy manatee groove), drums (suitcase stomp bass drum kick, conga/snare/tom tidal pulse).  
- **Electric Solo:** Before bridge—fuzz-edged electric guitar cuts loose, wild bends risin' like a rogue wave, 16-bar howl over acoustic bed.  
- **Ad-Libs:** Rum-glass clink percussive, barefoot stomp.

## Vocals & Harmonies
- **Lead:** Jax's rasp—smooth simmer verses (Kentucky hooch to rum glow), Chesney holler choruses (fist-pump fire, no-shoes grin).  
- **Harmonies:** Light 1-2 part whispers on chorus (no gospel)—falsetto C# lift "dawn dog," faint alto echo "hey now" beach-sway; swell crescendo-simple in final (intimate haunt). Solo rasp dominant, like bonfire confession.  
- **Delivery:** Sensory flow—sunscreen-salt sting, jetty barefoot stomp, rum-caramel burn on the dunes. Punch: "hell yeah," "arrr" ad-lib, sand toes.

## Production Notes
- **Intro/Outro:** Acoustic & steel pick reverb mist (conch hum, clink fade)—hushed finger-dance duet, drums ghost-light.  
- **Electric Solo:** Fuzz electric erupts before bridge—wild bends over acoustic/steel bed, bass pulse wistful, tom sigh build tension.  
- **Crescendo:** Drums layer suitcase thump/kick heavy in final chorus—acoustic/steel bends wild, bass drive, light whispers peak yacht thunder.  
- **Mix:** 80% raw acoustic/steel intimacy (yacht polish reverb), 20% tropical drum groove—no gloss, swell specter. Master e-bike/Ron Jon. Beginner tip: Em-D-C#m cycle, C# high E lick; electric solo: overdrive fuzz for rogue wave howl.  
- **Motto:** Sand, salt, soul—or bust on the next swell.
