[Intro] (Acoustic strum, steel slide like a cold one slidin’ across the bar)

[Verse 1]
Pedaled the A1A at dusk, flask bumpin’ my hip like an old friend’s grin,
Coconuts callin’ first—neon palms and rum where the happy hour begins.
Slingin’ key lime pie shots, bartender’s wink like a rogue wave tease,
D.O.G. laps the condensation, tail flaggin’ the breeze.
From there to Dirty Bird, where the dive’s deep as the tide’s pull low,
Pool cues clack like cannon fire, hell yeah, let the good times flow.

[Chorus]
Tiki trail holler on the Buffett Highway, from Coconuts to Tropics glow,
Rum burn sweet as a beachside kiss, sand-sift toes in the undertow.
Raise a flask to the neon ghosts, the strangers turnin’ kin,
Cocoa Beach bars, darlin’—where the nightin’ begins!
Hell yeah, conch shell serenade, let the Jimmy Buffett wind blow,
Tiki trail holler—sand, salt, soul, or bust on the next pour!

[Verse 2]
Tropics Lounge next, thatched roof swayin’ like a hammock dream,
Mai tais mixin’ with laughter, fireflies dancin’ in the moonbeam.
Slide into the booth, D.O.G. curls at my boots with a salty sigh,
Old salts spinnin’ pirate yarns ‘bout Blackbeard passin’ by.
Then wander to the others—Hearts in the sand, neon fish on the wall,
Every bar’s a chapter in this coastal free-for-all.

[Chorus]
Tiki trail holler on the Buffett Highway, from Coconuts to Tropics glow,
Rum burn sweet as a beachside kiss, sand-sift toes in the undertow.
Raise a flask to the neon ghosts, the strangers turnin’ kin,
Cocoa Beach bars, darlin’—where the nightin’ begins!
Hell yeah, conch shell serenade, let the Jimmy Buffett wind blow,
Tiki trail holler—sand, salt, soul, or bust on the next pour!

[Bridge] (Drop to solo acoustic hush, steel sigh like embers dyin’)
Ain’t no mainland nine-to-five gonna steal this neon grace,
From holler regrets to Space Coast embrace, we’ve found our place.
One more round for the ghosts in the glass, tomorrow’s another cruise,
D.O.G. nudges my boot—time to pay the tab and choose.

[Final Chorus] (Full swell—steel bends risin’, conga pulse tumblin’ like foam)
Tiki trail holler on the Buffett Highway, from Coconuts to Tropics glow,
Rum burn sweet as a beachside kiss, sand-sift toes in the undertow.
Raise a flask to the neon ghosts, the strangers turnin’ kin,
Cocoa Beach bars, darlin’—where the nightin’ begins!
Hell yeah, conch shell serenade, let the Jimmy Buffett wind blow,
Tiki trail holler forever—sand, salt, soul, let the good times flow!

[Outro] (Acoustic fade on G resolve, steel twinkle like fireflies on the tide)
Cocoa Beach… holler on, darlin’.
