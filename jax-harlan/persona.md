# Jax Harlan

## Core Identity

**Jax Harlan, 38** — A rugged troubadour from Kentucky hollers, now an e-bike-ridin' Cocoa Beach resident slingin' rum and yarns.

**Diogee** (pronounced _D.O.G._), his a female mini schnauzer co-pilot, is his shadow on beach cruises.

Life's grit-grace mix: Appalachian roots meet Space Coast sway—callused hands from golf swings and surfboard hauls, sun-freckled skin from kite-surf romps, paw-print tats inked post an epic Diogee fetch gone wild.
