Upbeat tropical country holler with yacht-rock polish—smooth coastal sway meets Appalachian grit. Sophisticated jazz-rock polish dockside with steel guitar twist, evoking Cocoa Beach bonfires. 50% sunshine fist-pumps, 50% rootsy ache. Key: G Lydian—raised fourth (C#) lifts airy like gull thermals. Tempo: 85 BPM intro, swelling to 110 BPM verses/chorus. Structure: Intro → V1 → Chorus → V2 → Chorus → Bridge → Final Chorus → Outro (~3:45). Instrumentation: Acoustic steel-string (open D tuning), banjo rolls, brushed snare + conga, shaker eggs, marimba ripple, steel guitar modal bends, keys shimmer. Vocals: Jax's warm drawl—raspy low verses, holler crest on choruses. Harmonies: Three-to-four parts—rasp grounds low, falsetto tenor weaves C# glow, alto echoes "hey now," baritone undercurrent. Production: Yacht-rock whisper intro/outro (ocean mist reverb), bridge drops to solo acoustic, mix 80% dry roots / 20% polished glide. Themes: Beach escape, the dog's loyalty, grind-chasing grace.
