[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Woke to the Atlantic's holler, pink sky crackin' like a shotgun shell,
Coffee black as my regrets, but the dog's bark says, "All's well."
She shakes off dreams in the foam, paws diggin' for buried treasures untold,
We chase the sun's first wink, leavin' paw prints in the gold.
Salt sting on my skin, like that old Kentucky rain turned to rum,
Her tail's a flag in the breeze—hell, we're already won.

[Chorus]
Oh, dawn dog on the beach... risin' with the tide's wild call,
Sunsets on the river... where the day's just startin' to fall.
From Atlantic fire to Indian River glow, we drift and sway,
My dog's my anchor... in this sand-soul ballet.
Hey now, paw prints in the tide... wash 'em clean, but they stay,
Beach life's our hymn, y'all—sing it loud... come what may!

[Verse 2]
Midday's a blur of kite strings tanglin' with the gulls' mad dance,
E-bike hummin' down the shore, her ears flappin' like a second chance.
We dodge them tourist traps, sniff out shells like secrets from the deep,
That one rogue wave tried to claim us once—now it's just a story we keep.
Freckles from the fight, calluses from the haul, but her wet nose nudge?
That's the grace note in the grit, turnin' wipeouts to a strut.

[Chorus]
Oh, dawn dog on the beach... risin' with the tide's wild call,
Sunsets on the river... where the day's just startin' to fall.
From Atlantic fire to Indian River glow, we drift and sway,
My dog's my anchor... in this sand-soul ballet.
Hey now, paw prints in the tide... wash 'em clean, but they stay,
Beach life's our hymn, y'all—sing it loud... come what may!

[Bridge]
Ain't no mainland rush gonna steal this glow from our bones,
From holler shacks to Space Coast stones, we've carved our own thrones.
The dog whispers in barks what the waves can't say—
"Keep chasin' the light, old man; tomorrow's another play."
Yeah, the ache of the pull, like a lost chord in the night,
But we rise with the sun, 'cause that's how we fight.

[Final Chorus]
Oh, dawn dog on the beach... risin' with the tide's wild call,
Sunsets on the river... watch the whole world's standin' tall.
From Atlantic fire to Indian River glow, we drift and sway,
My dog's my forever... in this endless beachside fray.
Hey now, paw prints in the tide... wash 'em clean, let 'em stay,
Life's a swell worth the ride—hell yeah, every damn day!

[Outro]
Sand, salt, soul... drift eternal, darlin'.
