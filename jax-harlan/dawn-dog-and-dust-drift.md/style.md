# Dawn Dog & Dusk Drift - Style.md

## Overall Vibe
Upbeat tropical country holler with a yacht-rock polish—smooth coastal sway meets Appalachian grit. Think Steely Dan dockside with a banjo twist, evokin' Cocoa Beach bonfires and A1A e-bike spins. 70% sunshine fist-pumps, 30% rootsy ache; always upliftin', like Diogee's tail after a wave chase.

## Key & Mode
- **Key:** G Lydian (G A B C# D E F# G)  
- **Why Lydian?** That raised fourth (C#) lifts airy like a gull thermal or kite loop—dreamy, ethereal glow without sharp edges. Bends bright on choruses, hangs wistful in the bridge, resolv'in' gentle like river embers.

## Tempo & Structure
- **Tempo:** Intro at 85 BPM (lazy hammock glide), swellin' to 110 BPM for verses/chorus (mid-tide roll).  
- **Structure:** Intro → V1 → Chorus → V2 → Chorus → Bridge → Final Chorus → Outro.  
- **Length:** ~3:45 runtime—tight as a surf session, room for crowd holler.

## Instrumentation
- **Core:** Acoustic steel-string guitar (fingerpick open D tunin' for yacht hush), banjo rolls (twinklin' the Lydian lift like paw prints in foam).  
- **Rhythm:** Brushed snare + conga pulse (wave lap), shaker eggs (tide hush). Light marimba ripple in intro for tropical mist.  
- **Leads:** Steel guitar weepin' modal bends (homesick gull vibe), keys shimmerin' like Indian River glass.  
- **Percussion Ad-Libs:** Diogee's "bark" as percussive hook in bridge—wet-nose nudge echo.

## Vocals & Harmonies
- **Lead:** Jax's warm drawl—raspy low simmer on verses (Kentucky rain turned rum), buildin' to holler crest on choruses.  
- **Harmonies:** Stack three-to-four parts in chorus—rasp grounds low, falsetto tenor weaves C# glow on "dawn dog/sunsets," alto echoes "hey now" hook. Baritone undercurrent for yacht depth; full choral swell on final repeat (beach choir ready). Whispered ghosts in bridge, epic peak on outro fade.  
- **Delivery:** Sensory twang—salt-sting grit, key lime ache, sand-sift uplift. Contractions flow rhythmic: "hell yeah," "come what may."

## Production Notes
- **Intro/Outro:** Yacht-rock whisper—reverb like ocean mist, fade hummed hook wordless.  
- **Bridge:** Drop solo acoustic, slow as bonfire embers; Lydian tension eases like a sigh.  
- **Mix:** 60% dry roots twang, 40% polished glide—no overproduction, just swell and sway. Master for e-bike speakers or pier jams.  
- **Themes Echo:** Beach escape (Atlantic fire to river glow), Diogee loyalty (anchor in the fray), grind-chasin' grace (wipeouts to struts). Motto weave: "Sand, salt, soul—or bust on the next swell."

*(Carve this on your six-string, darlin'. If we're cuttin' a track, Diogee's co-producin' with tail-thumps.)*
