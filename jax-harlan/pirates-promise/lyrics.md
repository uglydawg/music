Pirate's Promise
(Jax Harlan, with Diogee's paw-print seal—E Phrygian holler, flat F stingin' like Spanish steel, rum warmin' the strings.)
[Intro] (Instrumental: Flamenco-tinged fingerpick in E Phrygian—E F G A B C D E, slow reverb like mist off Matanzas Bay. Soft conga patter echoes cannon ghosts, hummed hook wordless and wary, faint clink o' rum glass fade-in.)
[Verse 1]
Pedaled up from Cocoa salt with Diogee ridin' shotgun low, rum flask bumpin' my hip like a lover's secret stow.
A1A hummin' old sins, where the live oaks hang like nooses slow,
St. Aug hit like a galleon's groan, 1565's iron stake,
Menéndez marchin' through the mangroves, French blood on the tidal wake.
Coquina walls chewin' cannon fire, Fountain bubblin' youth's tall tale,
Ponce de León's fever dream, sippin' lies from a sulfur veil—but damn if rum don't make it real.
[Chorus] (Phrygian bite lifts here—that flat F on "ghost town" twistin' eerie, harmonies layer three-deep: rasp lead grounds the grit, falsetto tenor haunts the "promise," alto echoes full like bridge lions' roar, rum-toast clink ad-libbed percussive.)
Oh, pirate's promise, whisperin' through the fort's stone teeth, rum burnin' sweet on the tongue like the sea's own deceit.
St. Augustine's lore unburied, treasures tumblin' from the deep,
From Huguenot shades in the cemetery gate to Gaspar's gold in the sand,
Devil's Bridge troll guardin' the night—devil take the mainland hand.
Hey now, black-eyed kids under oaks, ghosts dancin' the Timucua reel, raise a flask to the fire—beach life's a haunted hymn, y'all—sing it fierce, make the specters kneel!
[Verse 2]
Anastasia breakers coughin' up the '15 Fleet's watery grave,
Silver shards and emerald crosses, hurricane's greedy wave.
Blackbeard's blade in the museum gleam, Jose's gasp on the ghost tour wind, rum glow lightin' the path where the plunder's pinned.
Downtown's alive with pirate shades stompin' cobblestones at dusk, scarin' tourists from their ghost tours—wide eyes, fanny packs in a tusk.
British redcoats raidin' the bay, leavin' powder burns behind,
Diogee digs for doubloons fierce, tail flag in the briny spray,
Her bark cuts the fog like a cutlass—happiest hound in the fray, rum chasin' her zoomies all the way.
[Chorus] (Mode deepens—baritone under the stack for fort-depth rumble, conga pulse lappin' like Matanzas foam. Voices weave like oak tendrils, pullin' you into the lore, with a group "salud" holler on the toast.)
Oh, pirate's promise, whisperin' through the fort's stone teeth, rum burnin' sweet on the tongue like the sea's own deceit.
St. Augustine's lore unburied, treasures tumblin' from the deep,
From Huguenot shades in the cemetery gate to Gaspar's gold in the sand,
Devil's Bridge troll guardin' the night—devil take the mainland hand.
Hey now, black-eyed kids under oaks, ghosts dancin' the Timucua reel, raise a flask to the fire—beach life's a haunted hymn, y'all—sing it fierce, make the specters kneel!
[Bridge] (Drop to solo Phrygian pick—slow as a galleon drift, flat F hangin' wistful like a lost locket. Whispered harmonies ghost the edges, Diogee's "bark" ad-libbed percussive like a raven caw, rum-swirl glissando on the steel.)
Ain't no tourist trap gonna chain this fire from the Spanish vein,
From coquina quarries to the Bridge of Lions' eternal strain.
Diogee whispers in yips what the waves and shades can't spell—
"Chase the lore, old drifter; the treasure's in the tell, with rum to make it swell."
Yeah, the pull of the past, like a flat-note ache in the gale,
But we rise with the ghosts, 'cause that's the pirate's tale—flask high, never fail.
[Final Chorus] (Explode the mode—four-part harmonies crestin' on F, crowd-ghost ready, acoustic thick as bayou mist with flamenco fire and roots pull. Phrygian tension floods the fray like a full-moon wreck, end with a rum-raise roar.)
Oh, pirate's promise, echoin' from the fort's stone teeth,
St. Augustine's lore forever, treasures callin' from the deep.
From Huguenot shades in the cemetery gate to Gaspar's gold in the sand,
Devil's Bridge troll guardin' the dawn—devil take the faithless band.
Hey now, black-eyed kids under oaks, ghosts dancin' the Timucua reel,
Life's a swashbucklin' swell—hell yeah, every cursed deal, rum seal!
[Outro] (Fade Phrygian flamenco-style: Single notes arpeggiatin' the scale, harmonies hummin' soft as a shanty on the wind, resolv'in' tense on E with Diogee's tail-thump echo and a final flask clink.)
Coquina, cannons, curses... sail eternal, darlin'.
