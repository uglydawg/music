## Overall Vibe
Phrygian pirate holler—flamenco-tinged country ghost yarn, Buffett whimsy meets Chesney storm-soul, with St. Aug lore (coquina curses, downtown shades scarin' tourists). 70% swashbucklin' fun (rum toasts, doubloon digs), 30% eerie grit (Huguenot chills, Devil's Bridge troll). Think "A Pirate Looks at Forty" with banjo bite—105 BPM, for ghost-tour sing-alongs or Anastasia bonfires.

## Key & Mode
- **Key:** E Phrygian (E F G A B C D E)  
- **Why Phrygian?** Flat second (F) snarls exotic like a cutlass draw—tense allure on choruses (ghost promise), wistful hang in bridge (lost locket ache). Easy beginner: Open Em base, tweak F# to F low-fret—no barres, comfy like Simpson's eerie cousin.

## Tempo & Structure
- **Tempo:** Intro 85 BPM (fog-slow galleon), swell to 105 (tailgate raid roll).  
- **Structure:** Intro → V1 → Chorus → V2 → Chorus → Bridge → Final Chorus → Outro.  
- **Length:** ~3:50—snappy as a flask swig, room for "yo ho" hollers.

## Instrumentation
- **Core:** Acoustic steel-string (flamenco fingerpick open E, easy Em-D-C-B shapes), banjo rolls tumblin' like chain rattles.  
- **Rhythm:** Brushed snare + conga patter (cannon echo), shaker eggs (bay mist); steel pans tickle intro for tropical curse.  
- **Leads:** Steel guitar modal bends (gull-cry haunt), keys shimmerin' sulfur soft; mandolin lilt for coquina twang.  
- **Ad-Libs:** Diogee's "bark" as raven-scratch in bridge; rum-glass clink percussive.

## Vocals & Harmonies
- **Lead:** Jax's rasp—smooth simmer verses (Kentucky hooch to rum glow), Chesney holler choruses (fist-pump fire).  
- **Harmonies:** 3-4 parts stack chorus—low anchors grit, falsetto lifts F on "promise" (pirate whimsy), alto echoes "hey now" ghost-sway. Baritone depth for fort rumble; choral swell final (luau-haunt ready). Whisper ghosts bridge, epic toast outro.  
- **Delivery:** Sensory flow—sulfur sting, cobblestone stomp, rum-caramel burn, Diogee's yip-defiance. Punch: "hell yeah," "devil take," pirate "arrr" ad-lib.

## Production Notes
- **Intro/Outro:** Phrygian reverb mist (conch hum, flask clink fade).  
- **Bridge:** Solo pick slow-burn, F sigh like post-raid calm.  
- **Mix:** 50% flamenco polish, 50% roots snarl—no gloss, just swell and specter. Master for e-bike ghosts or Ron Jon raids. Beginner tip: Em-D-C cycle base, F lick high E for modal menace; let "pirate shades" line rattle low.  
- **Themes Echo:** Lore chase (galleon groans to tourist scares, Buffett drift), Diogee devotion (Chesney anchor in fray), grace in ghosts (plunder to "no chains, no problem" struts). Motto: "Coquina, cannons, curses—or bust on the next rum swell."
