[Verse 1]  
Pedaled north from Cocoa Beach with rum and the risin’ moon,  
the dog ridin’ shotgun, sniffin’ out a pirate’s ruin.  
Ponce Inlet cut the skyline, teeth sharper than a blade,  
Edward Teach still teachin’ lessons where the lost ships laid.  
Mosquito bar’ll ground your soul if you come in too proud,  
Calico Jack and Anne Bonny laughin' wicked loud.

[Chorus]
Ghost lights & rum on the water, swingin' low where the dead men drink,
Blackbeard’s lantern burnin’ slow, one more soul gonna sink.  
the dog barks at the shadows dancin’, tail flaggin’ the gale,  
Ponce Inlet keeps the black flag flyin'—hell yeah, on the Mosquito trail.

[Verse 2]
Stede Bonnet careened his sorrow right beneath the lighthouse glow,  
Broke his china, broke his honor, nowhere left to go.  
Black Caesar’s one-eyed mastiff still guards the jetty stones,  
Howlin’ at the nor’easter, keepin’ watch alone.  
I raise a flask to the lanterns movin’ out across the bar,  
Edward Teach still teachin'—greed'll take you just as far.

[Chorus]
Ghost lights & rum on the water, swingin' low where the dead men drink,
Blackbeard’s lantern burnin’ slow, one more soul gonna sink.  
the dog barks at the shadows dancin’, tail flaggin’ the gale,  
Ponce Inlet keeps the black flag flyin'—hell yeah, on the Mosquito trail.

[Bridge]
Ain’t no runnin’ from the lessons that the inlet’s gonna give,  
Cross her proud, you’ll join the crowd that never more will live.  
the dog digs the sand like she’s huntin’ for the truth,  
Whispers in her yip: "Old man, some treasures eat the youth…"

[Chorus]
Ghost lights & rum on the water, burnin’ bright where the dead men sing,  
Edward Teach still teachin’—hear the black flag ring!  
the dog howls with the lanterns swingin’ wild and free,  
Life's a swashbucklin' lesson—hell yeah, come sail with me!
