[Style: Outlaw pirate anthem, raw rasp vocal, light whisper harmonies on chorus. Acoustic fingerpick swagger + pedal steel weeping bends, standup bass heartbeat, suitcase kick tavern stomp. 108 BPM swagger to 118 crescendo, reverb like tavern smoke and harbor fog—ends fist-pump proud, no grave regrets.]

[Intro: Acoustic & steel duet pick, low E swagger, faint coin clink and tavern laugh]

[Verse 1]
I sailed with Hornigold and Caesar, Blackbeard lit his beard on fire,
Took the Spanish gold from the 1715, set the whole damn world afire.
Dug no holes on Rockledge bluff, no X upon the sand,
A pirate’s treasure’s meant for livin’—rum and women, understand?

[Chorus]
Spent or sold, not buried with the gold,
Every doubloon in my fist got a story to be told.
Raise a flask to the ones who burned it bright,
Hell yeah, we lived it all before the endless night.
Spent or sold—let the next fool dig alone,
I’ll be laughin’ in the tavern when the tide takes me home.

[Verse 2]
Nassau nights and Florida moons, Havana girls with eyes like rum,
We drank the cellars dry and danced till the risin’ sun.
No chest beneath the palmetto, no map for greedy hands,
Just empty pockets and full memories—pirate’s final stand.

[Chorus]
Spent or sold, not buried with the gold,
Every doubloon in my fist got a story to be told.
Raise a flask to the ones who burned it bright,
Hell yeah, we lived it all before the endless night.
Spent or sold—let the next fool dig alone,
I’ll be laughin’ in the tavern when the tide takes me home.

[Bridge – drop to solo acoustic & steel weep]
When the sea comes callin’ final, no regrets upon my lips,
Just the taste of rum and freedom from a thousand stolen sips.
Let ‘em search the dunes forever, let ‘em curse my empty grave,
I spent it while I breathed it—pirate proud and pirate brave.

[Final Chorus – full crescendo swagger]
Spent or sold, not buried with the gold!
Every doubloon in my fist got a story to be told!
Raise a flask to the ones who burned it bright,
Hell yeah, we lived it all—damn the endless night!
Spent or sold—let the next fool dig alone,
I’ll be laughin’ with the devils when the tide takes me home!

[Outro – steel bends into tavern cheer fade, one last coin clink and a hearty “hell yeah!”]
Spent or sold… sail on, boys.
