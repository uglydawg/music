**(Song Title: Boom on the Shore)**

_(Verse 1)_  
Sippin' on a rum drink, toes in the sand so fine,  
Cocoa Beach whisperin' secrets in the salty brine.  
schnauzer chasin' waves like she's got no care,  
Salt air tangled in her fur, wind blowin' back my hair.  
We drift down Jimmy Buffett Highway,
where the palm trees sway in the wind,  
Sun kissin' the horizon, paintin' that tangerine dream.

_(Chorus)_  
Oh, Cocoa Beach, you're my easy ride,  
With D.O.G. by my side, and the rocket 'bout to fly.  
Liftoff in the distance, fire trail 'gainst the blue sky,  
Then the boom rolls in like thunder, shakin' me right through.  
Sometimes it's quiet, just the tide and the breeze,  
But when that sonic boom hits, it brings me to my knees—  
Boom on the shore, yeah, that's the thrill we chase,  
In this Florida paradise, lost in your embrace.

_(Verse 2)_  
Mornin' walks at sunrise, fetchin' shells from the foam,  
D.O.G. bark echoes soft, like she's callin' the tide home.  
Surfboards dancin' lazy, locals ridin' the curl,  
While I'm dreamin' 'bout nothin', lettin' worries unfurl.  
Kennedy's callin' from across the water so wide,  
That rocket is risin', got the whole sky on its side.

_(Chorus)_

_(Bridge)_  
And in the afterglow, when the echoes fade away,  
We lay back on the blanket, watchin' stars start to play.  
Life's a launchpad, baby, one spark and we're gone,  
But here with you and the pup, this feels like where we belong.  
No rush, no hurry, just the rhythm of the sea,  
Cocoa's got that magic, settlin' deep in me.

_(Chorus - Outro, with fade)_  
Oh, Cocoa Beach, you're my easy ride... (fade on the breeze)  
D.O.G. by my side, rocket light the sky...  
Boom on the shore... oh, that boom on the shore... (Brings me to my knees)
Yeah, sometimes it's just a whisper, but it calls me back for more.
