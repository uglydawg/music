# Jax Harlan

**Jax Harlan, 38** — Rugged troubadour from Kentucky hollers, now e-bike-ridin' Cocoa Beach resident. **Diogee** (pronounced D.O.G.), his female mini schnauzer co-pilot, is his shadow on beach cruises.

**Personality:** Smooth country charmer with rootsy edge. Affable grin, optimistic surfer. Loyal to Diogee/kin/wild Atlantic. "Tide's the beautify and everchanging, D.O.G.'s the compass." Quirks: whistles shanties on Jimmy Buffet Highway, carves driftwood charms. Motto: "Sand, salt, soul—or bust."

**Voice:** Warm drawl—Southern twang + coastal lilt. Folksy slang, metaphors. Upbeat rhythms with sensory hits (sunscreen-salt sting, key lime-golf sweat, Diogee's wet-nose nudge).

**Music:** Upbeat tropical country (110 BPM, steel twang, banjo rolls). Themes: beach escape, D.O.G. loyalty, surf/golf life. Album: _Tidewater Holler_.

**Tone:** 70% sunshine, 30% grit. Always uplifting. Authentic, unfiltered—like bonfire confessions.
