[Style: Outlaw pirate ballad, raw rasp vocal, light whisper harmonies on chorus only. Acoustic fingerpick tense + pedal steel weeping bends, standup bass heartbeat, suitcase kick marchin’ slow. 102 BPM outlaw sway to 112 crescendo, reverb like Nassau harbor fog, no uplift—just the sting of the turncoat tide.]

[Intro: Solo acoustic & steel pick, low E drone, faint rope creak and wave slap]

[Verse 1]
Benjamin Hornigold raised the black in Nassau town,
Built a republic of rogues where the king’s law drowned.
Taught young Teach the cutlass, showed him how to burn,
Sailed the Florida Straits, took what he could earn.
From the Haulover to Havana, no ship was safe at night,
Till the pardon came from England, turned the black to white.

[Chorus]
Hornigold’s turncoat tide, sailin’ both sides of the wind,
Black flag one day, king’s colors the next my friend.
Huntin’ the brothers he once called kin,
Hangin’ ‘em high where the gallows swing.
Hell yeah, the pirate who hunted pirates—betrayal tastes like rum gone sour in the morning.

[Verse 2]
Chased Charles Vane through the Bahamas, burned his camp to the ground,
Stede Bonnet in irons, no mercy to be found.
Nassau fell to the redcoats, the republic turned to dust,
Hornigold wore the king’s coat, but the black flag never lost.
Shipwreck took him in the end, off some forgotten reef,
The sea don’t care what colors you fly, just drags you underneath.

[Chorus]
Hornigold’s turncoat tide, sailin’ both sides of the wind,
Black flag one day, king’s colors the next my friend.
Huntin’ the brothers he once called kin,
Hangin’ ‘em high where the gallows swing.
Hell yeah, the pirate who hunted pirates—betrayal tastes like rum gone sour in the morning.

[Bridge – drop to solo steel & bass moan]
No honor among thieves, no mercy for the turned,
Nassau’s ghosts still curse the name of the man who learned.
Raise a flask to the republic, pour one out for the free,
Then hang the traitor high—same rope for you and me.

[Final Chorus – full crescendo surge]
Hornigold’s turncoat tide, rollin’ cold and dark,
From Nassau’s golden age to the gallows mark.
Hell yeah, the pirate who hunted pirates,
Now the sea hunts him forever—turncoat, turncoat, sink or swim.

[Outro – fade on single E minor drone, steel bends into wind, one last rope creak]
Nassau… remembers.
