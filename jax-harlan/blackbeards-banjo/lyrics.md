Blackbeard’s Banjo (Down in Fruit Cove)
Verse 1
(spoken low, like a ghost story on the dock)
I was driftin’ down the St. Johns where the palm trees lean like drunks,
Heard a five-string pickin’ through the sawgrass, soundin’ half ramshackle, half punk.
Man in overalls and a beard full of cordite, eyes like Oklahoma dust,
Sittin’ on a driftwood log with a schnauzer and a ghost I swear I could almost trust.

Pre-Chorus
(Diogee barks twice, right on the two and four)
He said, “Son, this here’s Fruit Cove, where the river runs to rum,
And the pirates and the pickers still raise hell when the workin’ day is done.”

Chorus
(big ol’ fist-pump, kite-sail loud)
Well it's hey-ho, Blackbeard's banjo, ringin' through the live oak trees,
A ramblin' troubadour and ol' Teach tradin' verses on the evening breeze.
One’s fightin’ for the union, one’s fightin’ for the gold,
But they both love a ramblin’ dog and a story left untold.
Raise your jar to the moon, boys, let the salt wind make you whole—
There’s paw prints dancin’ with the devil down in Fruit Cove, down in Fruit Cove!

Verse 2
(steel guitar cries like gulls)
Teach had a fuse in his beard and a laugh like cannon smoke,
Said, “I robbed the king’s own navy, but your songs rob richer folk.
You steal their sleep with truth, lad, I just stole their tea,
But either way we’re outlaws ridin’ waves too wild to be free.”
The troubadour grinned, passed the jar, said, "This land ain't yours or mine,
It belongs to schnauzer paws and the poor folks standin’ in line.
But tonight we’ll tune in G, let the river keep the time,
And write a song so dangerous the governor’ll lose his mind.”

Chorus
(everybody howl on the “down in Fruit Cove”)
Well it's hey-ho, Blackbeard's banjo, ringin' through the live oak trees,
A ramblin' troubadour and ol' Teach tradin' verses on the evening breeze.
One’s fightin’ for the union, one’s fightin’ for the gold,
But they both love a ramblin’ dog and a story left untold.
Raise your jar to the moon, boys, let the salt wind make you whole—
There’s paw prints dancin’ with the devil down in Fruit Cove, down in Fruit Cove!

Bridge
(slow, spooky, waves lappin’ the hull)
Diogee barked at the moonlight, chased a crab clear to the reef,
Blackbeard carved her a golf-tee bone from the mast of the Queen Anne’s Revenge.
The troubadour scratched new words in the sand— "This cove belongs to us all"—
Then the tide came in and took ‘em, verse, beard, dog, and all.
Final Chorus
(full-throttle, bonfire roar)
Yeah it's hey-ho, Blackbeard's banjo, echoin' off the Matanzas bend,
A ramblin' troubadour and ol' Teach, ramblin' dogs until the end.
If you hear five strings at midnight where the mangroves kiss the sky,
That’s just two old rebels teachin’ my little D.O.G. how to fly.
So raise your jar to the moon, boys, let the salt wind make you whole—
There’s paw prints dancin’ with the devil down in Fruit Cove, down in Fruit Cove!
