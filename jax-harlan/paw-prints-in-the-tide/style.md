Acoustic folk rock with a relaxed, melancholic feel. The song is in a minor key, likely A minor, with a moderate tempo around 100 BPM. The primary instrumentation includes an acoustic guitar playing a fingerpicked arpeggiated pattern, a bass guitar providing a smooth, walking bass line, and a drum kit with a soft, brushed snare and light cymbal work, a pedal guitar. A male vocalist sings in a baritone range, with a slightly raspy, intimate quality, using a conversational delivery. The vocal melody is largely syllabic, following the chord changes. Production elements include a warm, slightly reverbed mix, giving a sense of space. The song structure follows a verse-chorus pattern with an instrumental break. The chord progression in the verse is a repeating minor chord progression, creating a contemplative mood. The chorus introduces a more open, slightly uplifting feel while maintaining the minor key. There are subtle background vocal harmonies in the chorus, adding depth. The overall dynamic is soft to medium, with no sudden changes in intensity.
