Paw Prints in the Tide

[Verse 1] (Gravelly murmur, acoustic picking slow and steady)
Woke to the sun easin' in like a familiar ghost,
Coffee steamin' dark, chasin' shadows we don't need most.
Hat tugged low, called to D.O.G., we wandered the white line,
Leavin' mainland echoes for this endless shoreline—
Yeah, we're driftin' easy, no anchors holdin' true,
Just me and my old friend, four paws treadin' new.

[Chorus] (Warm swell, harmonies like a soft breeze)
Are we on the beach? Yeah, we're lingerin' on the shore...
Nothin' but sandy shores, stretchin' evermore.
D.O.G. by my side, feels like forever's door—
Tail brushin' the wind, paws etch in the pour.
Oh, these dog days, they glow soft and true,
Paw prints in the tide, fadin' into you.
(Whoa... let that wave carry on...)

[Verse 2] (Build a touch of rhythm, lap steel humming low)
Slippin' past the day-trippers, chasin' shells half-buried deep,
Stackin' driftwood dreams while the secrets sleep.
He dives for the whitecaps like it's his quiet vow,
And I'm grinnin' through the salt, forgettin' somehow—
From those holler ridges to this Keys' quiet bend,
With D.O.G. pointin' the way, it's a road without end.

[Bridge] (Pause for breath, fingers dancing on strings)
Fireflies blink like memories slippin' loose,
We'll tip a shell to the wanderers, the wild, the truce...
No chart for these waters, just the sea's patient draw—
Boy, let's lean into the night, let the old year thaw.
(Acoustic solo: Gentle, wandering lines—bends like horizon haze, resolving to a peaceful hum, as if Jax glances at D.O.G. and smiles.)

[Chorus (Outro Drift)]
Are we on the beach? (Mmm, right where we belong...)
Are we on the shore? (Holdin' on, singin' soft and strong...)
Nothin' but sandy shores... (Whisper it to the foam...)
D.O.G. by my side, forevermore—
(Fade with echoing "Whoa"s, single guitar notes trailing off like footsteps in the surf—leavin' a quiet glow.)
