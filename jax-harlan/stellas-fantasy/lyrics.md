[Intro]  
*(Acoustic sunshine pick, steel twinklin’ like glitter on waves)*

[Verse 1 – Stella]  
Thanksgiving on the big boat, people everywhere I turn,  
Pushin’, shovin’, talkin’ loud—my little tummy’s startin’ to churn.  
Too many strangers in my space, too many lines just to eat,  
All I want is Cocoa Beach sand warm under my feet!

[Chorus – Stella lead, male baritone backup]  
Stella’s fantasy ain’t this crowded ship,  
It’s pink clothes and sparkles and an empty beach to skip!  
No more people in my way, no more elbows in my side,  
Just me and Daddy diggin’ holes big enough to hide!  
*(male baritone backup: That’s my girl, sparkles brighter than the boat lights!)*

[Verse 2 – Stella]  
Finally hit the shore, I kick off my pink shoes fast,  
Run straight to the water—nobody here at last!  
Shovel in the wet sand, fairy wings and glitter crown,  
Diggin’ the biggest hole this beach has ever found!

[Pre-Chorus – Stella excited]  
Then—clink!—my shovel hits somethin’ shiny and old…  
A real pirate doobloon, real pirate gold!

[Chorus – Both, male baritone backup harmony stronger]  
Stella’s fantasy just came true today,  
Pink pirate princess with treasure in her play!  
Blackbeard or Vane or maybe Sam Bellamy,  
Doesn’t matter whose it was—it’s sparkly and belongs to me!  
*(male baritone backup: Hell yeah, Captain Sparkle—richest seven-year-old on the sea!)*

[Bridge – Spoken over twinkly steel]  
male baritone backup: “What’cha gonna buy with that gold, baby girl?”  
Stella: “A quiet beach with nobody else—and a giant ice-cream swirl!”

[Final Chorus – Big bright sparkle lift]  
Stella’s fantasy is the beach and the sea,  
Sparkles, pink clothes, and treasure just for me!  
No more crowds, no more noise, just the waves and the sand,  
Best Thanksgiving ever with my doobloon in my hand!  
*(male baritone backup: My little queen of the coast—shine on, understand!)*

[Outro – Acoustic sparkle fade, steel like fairy dust]  
Stella & male baritone backup (together): Sparkles, pink, and gold… best fantasy ever told!
