Choose

[Verse 1]
When you look at me, you always shade your eyes
Like there's too much time between us, and all that's left are lies
I think I'm in love with you, but I can not be for sure
You say I'm the only one, but I see it in your eyes

[chorus]
You've gone and let another lover in your heart
He's got a part of you that I've needed from the start
I can't go on like this, I need you in my life
I've even thought of ways to ask you to be my wife (to be my wife)

[Verse 2]
But now I see you lookin' longingly at the door
Thinkin' bout your time with him, my heart is on the floor
Even though I know you need some other kinda love
I've given you every ounce of feelin' left in my soul

(chorus partial)
You've gone and let another lover in your heart
He's got a part of you that I've needed from the start

[Verse 3]
You tell me you love me still, but I see it in your eyes
You're thinking 'bout him now, I can hear it in your lies (Rough)
Don't tell me you love me now and then look away at him!
I will be there for you, but I will not share with him!
You can't be here and there, it's tearing me apart!
I've never felt this pain and It's too much for my heart....
Just say you love me now and I'll take you back again
We won't talk about it now, and I can just pretend 
No man has ever made you feel the way I do
Just promise me you'll never ever make me have to choose....

[Chorus]
You've gone and let another lover in your heart
He's got a part of you that I've needed from the start
I can't go on like this, I need you in my life
I've even thought of ways to ask you to be my wife

[Outro]
So here we are, standing at the edge
You've got to make a choice, I can't take another step
I'm waiting here, my heart in your hands
Just promise me you'll never ever make me have to choose again
Just promise me you'll never ever make me have to choose...
