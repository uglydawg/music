# Through the Pane (Grand Marquis Edition)

_(Tucker Hale – for the King of the 101)_

**Key:** A (capo 2, G shapes)  
**Tempo:** 96 BPM – velvet-smooth V8 idle, windows down, Pacific wind  
**Chords:** A – D – G – A (I–IV–bVII–I)  
**Turnaround:** F#m – G  
**Vibe:** Old Spice, vinyl seats warm from the sun, Rio ridin’ shotgun with the ghosts

[Verse 1]  
A D  
Company gave him a Grand Marquis the year he topped the coast  
G A  
White over baby-blue, land-yacht long as a lifetime of almosts  
A D  
Told me every pane in the rack held a little piece of how to get by  
G A  
“Load ’em careful, son—somebody’s gonna look through and see their whole sky”

[Verse 2]  
A D  
He’d ease that Mercury down the driveway, Old Spice leadin’ the way  
G A  
Bench seat big enough for Lee’s quarters, Roy’s wallet, and yesterday  
A D  
Lee’d ride shotgun with a grin and a roll for the library machine  
G A  
Roy’d argue from the back about who was buyin’ gas and ice-cold sweet tea

[Chorus]  
D A  
Look through the pane, you’ll see the pain  
D A  
Reflected in the chrome of a Grand Marquis shine  
G D  
Some days it’s ocean, some days it’s rain  
A G A  
But you keep that big wheel steady—that’s how you make it mine  
F#m G A  
Flaws and all, we love through the pane

[Verse 3]  
A D  
That Mercury carried him clear to the cliffs the night Lee took the turn  
G A  
Carried Roy’s loud laugh and Grandpa’s quiet burn  
A D  
Carried me to the graveyard in the front seat, twelve years old and cryin’  
G A  
Grandpa just rested one hand on my knee and kept that V8 hummin’

[Bridge – soft, motor-idle low]  
F#m G  
He said, “Glass shows the truth, boy—this car just gets us there  
D A  
Cracks let the light in, same as grace and prayer”

[Final Chorus – windows down, let it roar]  
D A  
Look through the pane, you’ll see the pain  
D A  
And a white Grand Marquis waitin’ past the fog and the years  
G D  
Every mile he drove still calls my name  
A G A  
I swear I smell Old Spice every time that big boat appears  
F#m G D  
Flaws and all, I love him—through the pane  
F#m G A  
Yeah, I see him clear now… behind the wheel again

[Outro – engine fade, one last low A]  
A G D  
White Grand Marquis, king of the coast highway  
A G A  
Still rollin’ smooth… still showin’ me the way
