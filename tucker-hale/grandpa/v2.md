# Through the Pane

_(Tucker Hale – final firelight pour, for the king and his long-shadowed court)_

**Key:** A (capo 2, G shapes)  
**Tempo:** 94 BPM – big V8 idle, windows down, salt in the air  
**Chords:** G – C – F – G (I–IV–bVII–I)  
**Turnaround:** Em – F  
**Vibe:** Old Spice, cracked leather, three ghosts and one dog breathin’ the same breeze

[Verse 1]  
G C  
Company rolled him a sleek black sedan the year he owned the coast  
F G  
Chrome like a mirror, long as regret, quiet as a ghost  
G C  
Told me every pane in the rack held a little piece of how to get by  
F G  
"Keep lookin' forward, boy—pain's just the price of what's on the other side"

[Verse 2]  
G C  
Grandpa stood shy of six foot, toes barely kissin' the brake  
F G  
But Lee and Roy rode tall as redwoods, lanky shadows in his wake  
G C  
Lee'd handed me quarters for the library, Roy'd fight for every check  
F G  
Three different heights of men teachin' one boy how to stand up straight

[Chorus – **the hook**, sing it like the whole damn Pacific is listenin']  
C G  
Through the pane I still feel the pain  
C G  
Windshield tears and the years rollin' down like rain  
F C  
But every crack catches sunrise the same  
G F G  
I keep drivin' forward—'cause that's how he spelled my name  
Em F G  
Through the pane, through the pain, I'm still his anyway

[Verse 3]  
G C  
That sleek sedan carried us to Lee's cliff, carried Roy's loud last laugh  
F G  
Carried me grown with a kid on my knee, same bench, different half  
G C  
Grandpa's hand on the wheel never shook, even when the cancer showed  
F G  
Just eased that big car gentle, like the road already knowed

[Bridge – low, almost spoken, let the low G drone]  
Em F  
He said, "Glass ain't for hidin'—it's for hurtin' pretty  
C G  
So tomorrow can find its way in and make the broken look holy"

[Final Chorus – full throat, windows down, gulls screamin' harmony]  
C G  
Through the pane I still feel the pain  
C G  
Old Spice and ocean mixin' with everything I can't explain  
F C  
But every crack catches sunrise the same  
G F G  
I keep drivin' forward—'cause that's how he spelled my name  
Em F C  
Through the pane, through the pain, I'm still his anyway  
Em F G  
Yeah, I see him clear now… straight on through the pane

[Outro – motor fades, one last whisper over open G]  
G F C  
Sleek black sedan, king of the coast highway  
G F G  
Still rollin' smooth… still showin' me the way
