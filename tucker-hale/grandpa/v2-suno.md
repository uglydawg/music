[Verse 1]
The Company rolled him a sleek black sedan the year he owned the coast
Chrome like a mirror, long as regret, quiet as a ghost
Told me every pane in the rack held a little piece of how to get by
Keep lookin' forward, boy—pain's just the price of what's on the other side

[Verse 2]
Grandpa stood shy of six foot, toes barely kissin' the brake
But Lee and Roy rode tall as redwoods, lanky shadows in his wake
Lee'd handed me quarters for the library, Roy'd fight for every check
Three different heights of men teachin' one boy how to stand up straight

[Chorus]
Through the pane I still feel the pain
Windshield tears and the years rollin' down like rain
But every crack catches sunrise the same
I keep drivin' forward—'cause that's how he spelled my name
Through the pane, through the pain, I'm still his anyway

[Verse 3]
That sleek sedan carried us to Lee's cliff, carried Roy's loud last laugh
Carried me grown with a kid on my knee, same bench, different half
Grandpa's hand on the wheel never shook, even when the cancer showed
Just eased that big car gentle, like the road already knowed

[Bridge]
He said, Glass ain't for hidin'—it's for hurtin' pretty
So tomorrow can find its way in and make the broken look holy

[Chorus]
Through the pane I still feel the pain
Old Spice and ocean mixin' with everything I can't explain
But every crack catches sunrise the same
I keep drivin' forward—'cause that's how he spelled my name
Through the pane, through the pain, I'm still his anyway
Yeah, I see him clear now, straight on through the pane

[Outro]
Sleek black sedan, king of the coast highway
Still rollin' smooth, still showin' me the way
