[Intro]
(Lonesome banjo roll, fiddle crying high and thin, doghouse bass thumpin')

[Verse 1]
(Raw vocal, Kentucky mountain edge, banjo and guitar picking soft)
I'm just a woman, a lonely woman,
Waiting on a weary shore.
I'm just a woman that's only human,
One you should be sorry for.
Got up this mornin' along about dawn,
Without a warnin' I found he was gone,
Why should he do it? How could he do it?
He never done it before.

[Chorus]
(Full band kicks—mandolin chop, fiddle double-stops, harmony vocals stack high)
Am I blue? Am I blue?
Ain't these tears in these eyes tellin' you?
Am I blue? You'd be too,
If each plan with your man done fell through.
Was a time I was his only one,
But now I'm the sad and lonely one... Lawdy.
Was I gay? 'Til today
Now he's gone, and we're through. Am I blue?

[Instrumental Break]
(Fiddle breakdown—fast and mournful, banjo answering back, mandolin tremolo)

[Verse 2]
(Voice cracks with Appalachian grit, tempo pushes harder)
It's aggravatin' to stand here waitin',
Waitin' for a triflin' man.
It set me hatin' to stand here waitin',
Suicide's my only plan.
I think it's awful, his treatment of me,
It's most unlawful how mean he can be.
I can't forget him, I'm bound to get him,
I'll run him down if I can.

[Chorus]
(Double-time feel, gang vocals on harmony, banjo driving hard)
Am I blue? Am I blue?
Ain't these tears in these eyes tellin' you?
Am I blue? You'd be too,
If each plan with your man done fell through.
Was a time I was his only one,
But now I'm the sad and lonely one... Lawdy.
Was I gay? 'Til today
Now he's gone, and we're through. Am I blue?

[Outro]
(Slow it down—solo banjo roll, fiddle holds one last lonesome note)
Am I blue...
