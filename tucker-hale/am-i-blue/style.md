Appalachian bluegrass with Tyler Childers-style raw Appalachian grit. Male vocalist with Kentucky mountain edge, raspy and emotionally worn. Lonesome banjo roll opening, fiddle crying high and thin throughout. Doghouse bass thumpin' steady, mandolin chopping rhythm and adding tremolo swells. Acoustic guitar fingerpicking supports the foundation. High harmony vocals stack on the chorus, gang vocal feel. Fast fiddle breakdown for instrumental section—mournful and technical, banjo answering back in call-and-response. Double-time feel pushes the second chorus harder. Minor key blues with mountain soul. Production raw and organic, close-mic'd vocal with natural room sound. Tempo starts slow and contemplative, builds to driving bluegrass energy, then slows back down for the outro with solo banjo roll and one last lonesome fiddle note.
