(Verse 1: Slow strum, acoustic guitar, fingers light on frets like toes in wet sand)   
Down where the Cocoa Beach breakers kiss the shore
the dog's nose high, chasin' crabs in the foam
Salt-stung whiskers twitchin' wild and free
Her paws kick up diamonds, leavin' trails for the sea
I whistle that old shanty from the panhandle porch
the bike is hummin' soft, rum warmin' my core
But hark—here comes trouble on a twilight prowl
A lady with a laugh like a Gulf wind's howl

(Chorus: Steel bends wailing, chant-along energy, crowd backup vocals)
Oh, leash and lope, cat on a string in the surf!
the dog's barkin' backup, tail whippin' the turf
Lady's eyes sparklin' brighter than biolum glow
Walkin' her whiskered wild one, stealin' the show
Sand-sift toes and sunscreen sting
Rum sweat mixin' with the tide's sweet swing
Leash and lope, darlin', let's chase that wave high!
Beach hearts tangled, under that palm-frond sky

(Verse 2: Gritty picking, ranch rope texture, building energy)
She's got that stray-cat strut, all sass in a harness pink
Clawin' at the leash like it's a longhorn's kink
Lady's sundress flappin', freckles dancin' free
Spinnin' tales o' city cages and this salty reprieve
Rio circles 'round, one ear cocked for the call
Sniffin' that feline fire, 'bout to spark a brawl
But nah—they truce in the shallows, splashin' knee-deep
Paw to paw, forgettin' the mainland's creep

(Chorus)
Oh, leash and lope, cat on a string in the surf!
the dog's barkin' backup, tail whippin' the turf
Lady's eyes sparklin' brighter than biolum glow
Walkin' her whiskered wild one, stealin' the show
Sand-sift toes and sunscreen sting
Rum sweat mixin' with the tide's sweet swing
Leash and lope, darlin', let's chase that wave high!
Beach hearts tangled, under that palm-frond sky

(Bridge: Drop to hush, just Telecaster and whisper, intimate and reflective)
Tide's the teacher, pullin' us all to bend
From Texas dust devils to this Cocoa Beach mend
That cat's got secrets in her emerald glare
Lady's got fire that could light up the air
Rio? She's the glue, loyal as the moon's pull
Turnin' strangers to strummers 'round the bonfire full
Ain't no chains holdin' souls on this stretch o' shore
Just leashes for laughin', and horizons galore

(Chorus: Full throttle, chorus crashing like reef break, maximum uplift)
Oh, leash and lope, cat on a string in the surf!
the dog's barkin' backup, tail whippin' the turf
Lady's eyes sparklin' brighter than biolum glow
Walkin' her whiskered wild one, stealin' the show
Sand-sift toes and sunscreen sting
Rum sweat mixin' with the tide's sweet swing
Leash and lope, darlin', we ride that wave high!
Beach hearts forever, 'neath the endless sky

(Outro: Fade on steel guitar sigh, warm and satisfied)
Yeah... sand, surf, soul—or bust on the next one
