**Leash & Lope**  
*(Verse 1 – Slow strum, fingers dancin' light on the frets, like toes siftin' wet sand)*  
Down where the Cocoa Beach breakers kiss the shore,  
the dog's nose high, chasin' ghosts in the foam.  
Salt-stung whiskers twitchin' wild and free,  
Her paws kick up diamonds, leavin' trails for the sea.  
I whistle that old shanty from the panhandle porch,  
my bike is hummin' soft, rum warmin' my core.  
But hark—here comes trouble on a twilight prowl,  
A lady with a laugh like a Gulf wind's howl.  

*(Chorus – Steel bends wailin', crowd chantin' along, fist-bumps at the bonfire edge)*  
Oh, leash and lope, cat on a string in the surf!  
the dog's barkin' backup, tail whippin' the turf.  
Lady's eyes sparklin' brighter than biolum glow,  
Walkin' her whiskered wild one, stealin' the show.  
Sand-sift toes and sunscreen sting,  
Agave sweat mixin' with the tide's sweet swing—  
Leash and lope, darlin', let's chase that wave high!  
Beach hearts tangled, under that palm-frond sky.  

*(Verse 2 – Pick it gritty now, like ranch rope frayed from a Rio rogue fetch)*  
She's got that stray-cat strut, all sass in a harness pink,  
Clawin' at the leash like it's a longhorn's kink.  
Lady's sundress flappin', freckles dancin' free,  
Spinnin' tales o' city cages and this salty reprieve.  
Rio circles 'round, one ear cocked for the call,  
Sniffin' that feline fire, 'bout to spark a brawl.  
But nah—they truce in the shallows, splashin' knee-deep,  
Paw to paw, forgettin' the mainland's creep.  

*(Chorus – Build it bigger, voices risin' like kite strings in the breeze)*  
Oh, leash and lope, cat on a string in the surf!  
the dog's barkin' backup, tail whippin' the turf.  
Lady's eyes sparklin' brighter than biolum glow,  
Walkin' her whiskered wild one, stealin' the show.  
Sand-sift toes and sunscreen sting,  
Agave sweat mixin' with the tide's sweet swing—  
Leash and lope, darlin', let's chase that wave high!  
Beach hearts tangled, under that palm-frond sky.  

*(Bridge – Drop to a hush, just Tele and whisper, the dog's wet-nose nudge in the quiet)*  
Tide's the teacher, pullin' us all to bend,  
From Texas dust devils to this Cocoa Beach mend.  
That cat's got secrets in her emerald glare,  
Lady's got fire that could light up the air.  
Rio? She's the glue, loyal as the moon's pull,  
Turnin' strangers to strummers 'round the bonfire full.  
Ain't no chains holdin' souls on this stretch o' shore—  
Just leashes for laughin', and horizons galore.  

*(Final Chorus – Full throttle now, chorus crashin' like a perfect reef set, uplift in every bend)*  
Oh, leash and lope, cat on a string in the surf!  
the dog's barkin' backup, tail whippin' the turf.  
Lady's eyes sparklin' brighter than biolum glow,  
Walkin' her whiskered wild one, stealin' the show.  
Sand-sift toes and sunscreen sting,  
Agave sweat mixin' with the tide's sweet swing—  
Leash and lope, darlin', we ride that wave high!  
Beach hearts forever, 'neath the endless sky.  
*(Fade on a steel sigh)* Yeah... sand, surf, soul—or bust on the next one.
