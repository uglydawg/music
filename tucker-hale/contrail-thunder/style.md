Laid-back surf-country: Texas twang meets Cocoa Beach soul. Warm drawl vocals—Jack Johnson's breezy acoustic fused with Jamey Johnson's outlaw grit. 108 BPM groove in Mixolydian mode: fingerpicked acoustic guitar with dominant seventh bends, crying steel guitar wailin' unresolved fire like rocket echoes in salt spray, subtle percussion like waves on sand. Verses simmer intimate: wet sand between toes, salt spray sting, rum warmth, e-bike hums down A1A. Choruses explode chant-along bonfire energy—fist-pumping singalongs, call-and-response backups. Bridge whispers Telecaster confessions, builds to full-throttle uplift. Sensory hits: sunscreen-salt sting, sand-sift toes, bioluminescent glow, dog's wet-nose nudges, ranch rope textures vs. reef break rhythms. Folksy metaphors: longhorns in hurricane swells, porch wisdom clashing coastal redemption. 70% surf sunshine optimism, 30% rootsy outlaw depth. Ends on hope—pier strums meet honky-tonk heart, drifters home in endless sky.
