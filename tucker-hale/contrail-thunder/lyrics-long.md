(Laid-back surf-country vibe: Acoustic twang at 108 BPM in Mixolydian mode, steel guitar bends risin' with the rocket roar, the dog's joyful howl on the fade.)

[Verse 1]
Sittin' on Cocoa's curve where the A1A sighs,
Six-string scarred from panhandle fights and these Florida lies.
Sun's peekin' lazy over thunder clouds east,
Brewin' a storm that whispers "hold on, at least."
The dog's dodgin' waves like a longhorn in the spray,
One ear cocked for the rumble, tail cuttin' the gray.
Horizon's hummin' low, that pad's glowin' white-hot,
Countdown tickin' softer than a kite line's knot.

[Chorus]
Oh, con-trail thunder, streak that sky with your fire!
Sonic boom kissin' the breakers, liftin' us higher.
Sunrise gold in the growl, the dog's barkin' the call,
Rocket's ghost trail dancin'—we rise or we fall.
Rum sweat on the strings, thunder's sweet sting,
Cocoa hearts thunderin', lettin' the wild things sing—
Con-trail thunder, darlin', chase that horizon glow!
Beach souls launchin', under the storm's salty show.

[Verse 2]
Palm fronds rustlin' secrets as the gulls wheel and cry,
Thunderheads tumblin' east like regrets in the sky.
She's breakin' free—flames lickin' the dark, leavin' a scar,
Con-trail curlin' lazy, like a lover's goodbye from afar.
The dog's circles my boots, wet nose nudgin' the truth,
"Dodge the wave, chase the boom—ain't no losin' the proof."
From Amarillo porches to this Space Coast bend,
We strum through the shake, where the wild winds don't end.

[Chorus]
Oh, con-trail thunder, streak that sky with your fire!
Sonic boom kissin' the breakers, liftin' us higher.
Sunrise gold in the growl, the dog's barkin' the call,
Rocket's ghost trail dancin'—we rise or we fall.
Rum sweat on the strings, thunder's sweet sting,
Cocoa hearts thunderin', lettin' the wild things sing—
Con-trail thunder, darlin', chase that horizon glow!
Beach souls launchin', under the storm's salty show.

[Bridge]
Tide's the tether, pullin' us back to the shore,
But that boom's a reminder—we're built for the soar.
Thunder clouds crackle, sunrise bleeds through the gray,
Rocket's echo lingin', turnin' night into day.
Ain't no chains on this stretch, just the pull of the dream,
From dustbowl drifts to con-trail streams.
The dog's eyes sparklin' wild, like she knows the whole score—
Strum on, souls risin', forever wantin' more.

[Final Chorus]
Oh, con-trail thunder, streak that sky with your fire!
Sonic boom kissin' the breakers, liftin' us higher.
Sunrise gold in the growl, the dog's barkin' the call,
Rocket's ghost trail dancin'—we rise, yeah, we rise through it all.
Rum sweat on the strings, thunder's sweet sting,
Cocoa hearts thunderin', lettin' the wild things sing—
Con-trail thunder, darlin', we chase that horizon glow!
Beach souls eternal, under the storm's endless show.

[Outro]
(Fade on steel guitar sigh and the dog's joyful howl—instrumental swell like a sonic afterglow.)
Yeah... launch and linger, or bust on the next one.
