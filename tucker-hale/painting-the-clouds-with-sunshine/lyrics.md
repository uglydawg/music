(Verse)
This life's a play from the start
It's hard to play through a part
When there's an ache in your heart
All day

I have my dreams till the dawn
I wake to find they are gone
But still the play must go on
They say

(Chorus)
When I pretend I'm fine
I never feel that way
I'm only painting the clouds with sunshine

When I hold back a tear
To make a smile appear
I'm only painting the clouds with sunshine

Painting the blues
Beautiful hues
Colored with gold and old rose
Playing the clown
Trying to drown
All of my woes
See pop shows near Las Vegas
Get tickets as low as $36

Fontaines D.C.
Though things may not look bright
They'll all turn out all right
If I keep the painting the clouds with sunshine

(Instrumental break)

Painting the blues
Beautiful hues
Colored with gold and old rose
Playing the clown
Trying to drown
All of my woes

Though things may not look bright
They'll all turn out all right
If I keep the painting the clouds with sunshine
