[Verse 1]
From the Strip in Vegas, where the speedway glows bright,
Millions of bulbs dancin' through the desert night.
Glitterin' tunnels and reindeer in flight,
Feels like sin city found its holiday light.

[Verse 2]
Head east to New York, Rockefeller's tree so tall,
Dyker Heights houses goin' all out, y'all.
Skatin' on ice 'neath the skyscraper sprawl,
Big apple shine makin' the whole world feel small.

[Chorus]
Oh, these worldwide wonder lights, burnin' bright across the sea,
From Singapore's Orchard Road arches to Rio's floatin' tree.
Medellín's river runnin' rivers of gold,
Tokyo twinklin' like stars in the cold.
Strasbourg's old streets wrapped in fairy-tale gleam,
Chasin' that glow, livin' the dream—
Sand, surf, soul, and a million lights strong,
Merry Christmas, y'all, sing along!

[Verse 3]
Down in Singapore, them arches light the way,
Orchard Road sparklin' like a tropical day.
Brazil's lagoon with that giant tree afloat,
Dancin' on water, makin' my heart take note.

[Verse 4]
Medellín magic, figures tall and grand,
Colombia callin' with lights in the land.
Tokyo's illuminations, high-tech and bold,
Strasbourg's markets, stories centuries old.

[Bridge]
Rio's nudgin' my boot, barkin' at the moon so full,
Remindin' me home's where the heart pulls—
But damn, these lights 'round the world make me roam,
From Cocoa Beach foam to wherever they glow.

[Chorus (outro)]
Yeah, these worldwide wonder lights, burnin' bright across the sea...
Merry Christmas everywhere, from Rio, Tucker, and me.
