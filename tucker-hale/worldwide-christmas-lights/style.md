Surf-country Christmas travelogue, upbeat and warm. 112 BPM, key G (transpose up 2 semitones), simple I–IV–V grooves with occasional bVII (Mixolydian lift). Acoustic guitar strum + bright Tele twang, pedal steel swells, warm bass, brushed kit, handclaps/tambourine; subtle sleigh bells/shakers for holiday sparkle (not cheesy). Big rolling sing-along chorus like an ocean swell; verses laid-back, cinematic “worldwide lights” snapshots (Vegas Strip, NYC tree/Dyker Heights, Singapore arches, Rio floating tree, Medellín, Tokyo, Strasbourg). Bridge turns tender: Rio the dog nudges you back toward Cocoa Beach “home pulls.” Male vocal: warm Texas drawl with a little grit; optimistic, beachy. Mix: wide, bright, sparkling highs, punchy kick, airy reverb; end uplifting.
