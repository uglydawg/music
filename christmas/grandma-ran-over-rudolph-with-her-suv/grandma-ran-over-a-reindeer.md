[Verse 1] (Warm acoustic strum, soft fiddle intro—build that family glow)
Snow's blanketing the Kentucky hills so deep and white tonight,
Grandkids trimmin' cedar lights, gigglin' by the stove's warm light.
Pawpaw pours hot toddies, the dog chases bows in drifts,
Mama's derby pie steamin', fillin' up our holler hearts.

[Pre-Chorus] (Rising melody, pedal steel swell—tension like fog on the road)
But Grandma grabbed her keys too quick, cataracts in the dark,
Said she'd dash to town for ribbon, left us howlin' at the spark.

[Chorus] (Big boot-stomp drop—gang vocals on the hook, fiddle reel explodes)
Ho-ho-ho down this icy lane,
Jingle bells and family pain,
Grandma hit a reindeer—
Everything's alright!

[Post-Chorus/Hook Repeat] (Punchy tag, harmonies stack—crowd-sing simple, like a viral loop)
Yeah, Rudolph's limpin' but he's grinnin',
Nose still glowin' through the din,
Kentucky Christmas, we pull through!

[Verse 2] (Quick cut—3 lines, gravel-voice rasp, drums kick harder)
Black ice gleamin' under moon, fog thick as grandma's lies,
Headlights caught that red-nose stray, then CRASH—antlers in the skies.
Grandkids screamed, we all piled out, hearts racin' wild and true.

[Chorus] (Double-down roar—add sleigh bells chaos, full band holler)
Ho-ho-ho down this icy lane,
Jingle bells and family pain,
Grandma hit a reindeer—
Everything's alright!

[Post-Chorus/Hook Repeat] (Layer laughs ad-libs, fade fiddle tag)
Yeah, Rudolph's limpin' but he's grinnin',
Nose still glowin' through the din,
Kentucky Christmas, we pull through!

[Outro] (Soft acoustic fade, whispered "Merry holler nights...")
Rudolph or not, love's the real light.
