[Intro]
(4-bar fiddle + sleigh-bell shaker)

[Verse 1] (10–11 syl)
Snow’s piled high on the Kentucky ridge tonight
Grandkids stringin’ lights while the fire burns bright
Pawpaw’s pourin’ toddies, the dog’s stealin’ bows
Mama’s derby pie got the whole holler in a glow

[Pre-Chorus] (rising, half-time feel)
Grandma winked, grabbed the keys to her brand-new SUV
“Cataracts or not, I’m just runnin’ to Dollar Tree”

[Chorus] (big drums, gang vocals)
Ho-ho-ho on this icy road
Jingle bells and a heavy load
Grandma ran over Rudolph with her SUV
But everything’s alright, y’all, wait and see

[Post-Chorus] (instant earworm repeat)
Rudolph’s limpin’ but his nose still shines
Kentucky Christmas gonna be just fine
Yeah, we pull through

[Verse 2] (4 tight lines)
Black ice shimmered like a lie beneath the moon
Red glow in the fog came a half-second too soon
Bumper met antlers, grandkids screamed in the back
Grill full of reindeer, hood ornament went crack

[Pre-Chorus 2] (steel swells)
We jumped out in pajamas, breath hangin’ in the air
Grandma whisperin’ “Lord, I swear there wasn’t nothin’ there”

[Chorus]
Ho-ho-ho on this icy road
Jingle bells and a heavy load
Grandma ran over Rudolph with her SUV
But everything’s alright y’all, wait and see

[Post-Chorus]
Rudolph’s limpin’ but his nose still shines
Kentucky Christmas gonna be just fine
Yeah, we pull through

[Bridge] (half-time, spoken-sung over muted guitar)
Vet showed up with duct tape and a flask of Jim Beam
Patched that boy up—Rudy’s back on the team
Santa texted “Keep him—he’s earned the night off anyway”

[Final Chorus] (key up half step, full choir)
Ho-ho-ho on this icy road
Jingle bells and a heaven-sent load
Grandma ran over Rudolph with her SUV
But Rudolph’s dancin’ now, nose lit up like the tree
Yeah, everything’s alright, y’all, believe me

[Post-Chorus / Outro] (repeat & fade under laughter)
Rudolph’s limpin’ but his nose still shines
Kentucky Christmas turned out fine
Grandma’s ridin’ shotgun from now on… we pull through
